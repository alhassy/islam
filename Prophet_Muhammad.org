  18 on it.  The Prophet's age is $81 - 18 = 63$!  /Also/, Allah has 99 names:
  $81 + 18 = 99$!

# Imam Hassan:
#  + Buried in Jannat al-Baqi cemetery in Medina.
#    - Which was destroyed in 1925 CE by the Wahabis, who dismiss shrines
#      as leading to polytheism, /shirk/.

* Event of Mubahalah
In 10 AH, a group of Christians disputed with the Prophet about Isa ibn Maryam, Jesus.

- Like prophet Jesus, prophet Adam also had no father; moreover, he also had no mother.

+ They were commanded [[https://quran.com/3/61][⟨3:61⟩]] to perform /mubahalah/:
      Each group should ask God to destroy the liars.

\room
Quran 3:61 mentions our sons, our women, and ourselves in reference
  to who the Prophet took with him: Hassan and Hussein, Fatimah, and Ali.

\room
The Prophet has said:
  + /Hassan and Hussein are the masters of the youth of paradise./
  + /All the people of paradise are youths./

# Imam Sadiq has said that [[https://quran.com/16/16][⟨16:16⟩]] means the Prophet is the star and the landmarks
# are the Imams.
