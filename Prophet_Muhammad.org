* Why “{{{S}}}” and “{{{A}}}”?

  # The Quran commands it, in 33:56.
It is a matter of respect and love [[https://quran.com/33/56][⟨33:56⟩]]: The letter “@@latex:\mbox{\RL{ص}}@@”
is the first letter of the /Arabic/ phrase “𝒮allallahu 𝒜layhi 𝒲a-alihi 𝒲a-sallam”
(𝒮𝒜𝒲𝒲), which means “𝒫eace ℬe 𝒰pon ℋim and his ℋousehold” (𝒫ℬ𝒰ℋℋ).  Likewise for
“@@latex:\mbox{\RL{ع}}@@”; [[https://quran.com/37/181][⟨37:181⟩]], [[https://quran.com/19/15][⟨19:15⟩]], [[https://quran.com/37/120][⟨37:120⟩]].
#
# 37:79, 37:109, 37:120 , 37:130 , 37:181 , 19:15 , 19:33.
# We say عليه السلام after the other Prophets. It transliterates to "Alayhi al-Salaam" from which the abbreviation AS is derived. It translates to "Peace be upon him" from which the abbreviation PBUH is derived.

#+latex: \vspace{-0.7em}
When referring to him, the Prophet {{{S}}} said we should say:
/O Allah, bless Muhammad and the family of Muhammad as You blessed the family of
Ibrahim. You are Praised and Glorious./

# Many Sources: https://sunnah.com/search?q=the+family+of+Muhammad+as+You+blessed+the+family+of+Ibrahim.+You+are+Praised+and+Glorious.



# ---which is sometimes abbreviated ‘PBUHH’
# or ‘SAWW’.

# Likewise the letter “@@latex:\mbox{\RL{ع}}@@” is the first letter of the /Arabic/
# phrase /aliyah as-salam/ (/AS/) / “Peace be upon him/her”.

In 10 AH, a group of Christians disputed with the Prophet {{{S}}} about Isa ibn
Maryam, Jesus.

- Like prophet Jesus, prophet Adam also had no father; moreover, he also had no mother.

      Each group should ask God to destroy the liars.

Fatimah {{{A}}}, and Ali {{{A}}}.
