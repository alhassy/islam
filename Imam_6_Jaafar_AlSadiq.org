* The Abbasids Caliphate

# https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Caliphs

+ The Ummayad Caliphate:
  - Muawiyah ibn Abi Sufyan attacked Imam Ali at the battle of Siffin.
  - He became 6ᵗʰ caliph and eventually killed the 5ᵗʰ caliph, Imam Hassan ibn Ali.

   :All-Ummayad_caliphs:
  - Caliphes: Muawiya I → Yazid I → Muwaiya II → Marwan I, ibn Hakm → Abd al-Malik
    → Al-Walid I → Sulayman ibn Abd Al-Malik → Umar II → Yazid II → Hisham ibn Abd Al-Malik
    → Al-Walid II → Yazid III → Ibrahim ibn Al-Walid → Marwan II

   # Sufyanids ⇒ 661-684 ;; Marwanids ⇒ 684-750
  :End:

+ The 6ᵗʰ Imam lived in the time of Ummayad Caliphs from  Marwan I, ibn Al-Hakm,
  until the end of the dynasty with Marwan II.
  # Marwan II is grandson of Marwan I.

+ The Abbasids, descendants of Al-Abbas, the Prophet's uncle, seized control in 750 CE.

+ The 6ᵗʰ Imam was neutral: He did not pursue power nor did he aid others, such as the Abbasids, in doing so.

  \newpage
* The Islamic Academy

  + Being neutral, the 6ᵗʰ Imam was able to teach in a school that trained 4000 students, including:
    - Abu Hanifa and Malik ibn Anas, who later each founded a school of law.
    - Wasil ibn Ata, who later founds the Mutazila, “rationalist”, school.

  + The Imam's lessons ranged from theology to the physical sciences.
    - One of his students is Jabir ibn Hayyan, the father of early chemistry.

  + The number of traditions left behind by the Imam and his father were more than
    all those of the Prophet and the other Imams.

  + Imam Al-Sadiq is thus an important figure in multiple branches of Islam.

  \room
  Al-Sadiq, like his predecessor Imam Ali, is considered by Sufis to
  have great spiritual knowledge.

* Decisions ---\emph{al-amr bayn al-amrayn}

+ The Imam says that God decreed some things absolutely
  but other things were left for humans to decide.

+ Not predestination but not complete free will either, instead
    somewhere in the middle.

* Quranic Interpretation

 The Imam says there are four ways to view the Quran:

 1. The plain statements ---for the common people
 2. The implied intent ---for the elite, the intellects
 3. The hidden meanings ---for the ‘friends of God’
 4. The exalted spiritual doctrines ---these are the ‘province of the prophets’

* Attempting to End Imamah

  + Fearing he would take power as Imam, the Abbasids harassed him.
    - They burned his home and occasionally imprisoned him.

  + After the Imam died, Al-Mansur ordered that whoever was
    named as the next Imam in Al-Sadiq's testament would be killed.

  + Imam Al-Sadiq's testament named four people; in order:
    The caliph Al-Mansur, the governor of Medina, his eldest son Abdullah,
    then his younger son Musa.


* Death

  + Aged: 65 years old
    # \hspace{1em} ---
    - Poisoned at the order of the second Abbasid caliph, al-Mansur.

+ Like 3 Imams before him, he was buried in Jannat Al-Baqi in Medina, Saudi Arabia.
    - Which was destroyed in 1925 CE by the Wahabis, who dismiss shrines
      as leading to polytheism, /shirk/.
